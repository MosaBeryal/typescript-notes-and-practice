# What is TypeScript?

In simple terms, **TypeScript** is **JavaScript with static typing**. It is a superset of JavaScript, which means it includes all JavaScript features plus additional features that provide strong typing and improved tooling. TypeScript helps you write better, more maintainable JavaScript code, especially as projects scale.

- **TypeScript** was created by **Microsoft**.
- Both **TypeScript** and **React** were created by the same person, **Anders Hejlsberg**.
- TypeScript provides **static typing**, which helps catch errors early, enhances editor support, and improves the overall developer experience.

## Basics

- **Type Inference**: TypeScript will automatically infer the type of a variable if no type is explicitly defined. However, it's best practice to explicitly specify the type for better code clarity and consistency.

Example:
```typescript
const name: string = "mosa"; // Explicitly specifying the type
```

If the type is not specified, TypeScript will infer it based on the assigned value.

## Terminology

- **Strongly Typed Languages**: In strongly typed languages like TypeScript, you must specify the types of variables and data structures. The compiler checks these types at compile time.
  
- **Loosely Typed Languages**: In loosely typed languages like JavaScript, the types of variables are not explicitly defined, and the language will automatically convert data types when necessary.

> **Weakly Typed** and **Loosely Typed** are often used interchangeably.

- **Static Typing**: In TypeScript, types are checked at **compile time**. Errors are caught during development.

- **Dynamic Typing**: JavaScript is **dynamically typed**, meaning types are checked at **runtime**.

## Benefits of TypeScript

1. **Self-Documenting Code**: By defining types, the code becomes more readable and self-explanatory, which helps developers understand the logic and structure more easily.
   
2. **Catch Errors Early**: TypeScript helps catch type-related errors during development, reducing the likelihood of runtime errors and making debugging easier.
   
3. **Great for Teams**: TypeScript is highly beneficial for teams working on large projects. It ensures consistency, improves collaboration, and makes refactoring safer.

## TypeScript Configuration

- **`noEmitOnError`**: If this configuration is set to **true**, TypeScript will not emit (compile) the output files unless all the type errors are fixed. This prevents generating broken JavaScript code when there are unresolved issues.

Example of `tsconfig.json`:
```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "noEmitOnError": true
  }
}
```

With this setting enabled, TypeScript ensures that only error-free code gets compiled into JavaScript, preventing the deployment of faulty code.

---

## Summary

- TypeScript is a **superset** of JavaScript that adds **static typing** for better error checking, tooling, and developer experience.
- It is especially useful for **large-scale applications**, offering **self-documenting code**, **error detection**, and **better collaboration** in teams.
- TypeScript's **configuration options** like `noEmitOnError` give you more control over the compilation process, ensuring you generate JavaScript only when there are no type errors.
