Typescript help us to write better javaScript.

TypeScript is superset of javaScript

<!-- Basics -->

When we not specify any time then typescript will automatically infer.

We can also explicitly specify type for the variable.

const name:string = "mosa"

<!-- Terminologies -->

Strongly typed languages mean to specify data types.

TypeScript is strongly typed language where we specify the type of varibles.

Loosely typed do not require the specification of data types as we have in javaScript so javaScript is loosely typed language.

Weekly typed language and loosely are synonyms

- Static Typed TSC, types are checked at compile time.


- JavaScript is dynamically typed , types are checked at run time.


<!-- Benefits Include  -->

= Catch errors in dev.
